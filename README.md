# React Gallery

## Description

I made a gallery in React that allows users to upload, delete, and like images in the gallery. I used axios to allow these functions to take place. The project is divided into components for better organization.

## Installation

1. Create a database called `react-gallery` in Postico.
2. Run the queries in the database.sql file.
3. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal.
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal.
6. Click the link to open up the browser after running the client. 

## Usage

1. Add an image to the gallery using the form inputs on the top of the screen.
2. View the image description by clicking on the image, to view the image again click on the description.
3. Like an image in the gallery using the like button under the image. 
4. Delete an image from the gallery using the delete button under the image.
